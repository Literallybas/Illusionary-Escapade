# Illusionary Escapade

## Overview
"Maze Game: You're Your Own Enemy!" is a simple yet thought-provoking maze game built with Python's `tkinter` module. The objective is to navigate through a maze while avoiding your shadow, which mirrors and competes against your movements. The game is a metaphorical take on how sometimes we can be our own worst enemy.

## Features
- **Maze Navigation:** Move through the maze using arrow keys while avoiding obstacles and walls.
- **Dynamic Opponent (Shadow):** Your shadow follows and competes with your movements, adding a strategic challenge.
- **Win Condition:** 
  - Reach the green cell (goal) to win.
- **Lose Condition:** If your shadow catches you, the game ends.
- **Randomized Shadow Movement:** Adds unpredictability to the challenge.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with Python's `tkinter` for an engaging graphical experience.

## Installation
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
